# Binary-Search-Tree

This is what I got while creating a Binary Search Tree that has the next methods in it:
    -add(value) = adds new nodes to the tree
    -size() = it returns how much nodes are in the tree
    -contains(value) = given an argument it returns true or false if that value is in the tree
    -depthFirstForEach(cb, order) = it receives a callback that pushes the values to an array and the given arguments: -in-order: left-root-right
                                                                                                               -pre-order: root-left-right
                                                                                                               -post-order:left-right-root

    -breadthFirstForEach(cb) = it receives a callback that pushes the values to an array and prints level by level from left 
                             to right
